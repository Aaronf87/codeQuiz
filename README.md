# Code Quiz App

Hi there!ðŸ‘‹

At some point in my journey to become a full-stack web developer  ðŸ’», I likely will be asked to complete a coding assessment as part of an interview process. A typical coding quiz includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use my skills covered to write a app that runs on JavaScript. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.



## Test you knowledge with this The App in action!

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
