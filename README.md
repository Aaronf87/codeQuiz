# Code Quiz
Hi there!

At some point in my journey to become a full-stack web developer, I likely will be asked to complete a coding assessment as part of an interview process. A typical coding quiz includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use my skills covered to write a app that runs on JavaScript. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface.


## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
